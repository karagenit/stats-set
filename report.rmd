# The Game

Our game is a reinterpretation of a card game titled "Set". Essentially, you attempt to match together *sets* of three cards to score points. Further instructions (and the game itself!) can be found online:

# Probability Model

Because our game relies upon player skill to determine payout (and not just chance), our probability model is **empirical**. Video of us collecting data to create this model can be found on Google Drive, [here](). <!-- TODO add drive link -->

## Collected Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
raw <- read.csv("./src/data.csv", header=TRUE)
scores = raw$Score
scores = scores[!is.na(scores)]
print(scores, row.names=FALSE)
```

<!-- dot plot of data -->

<!-- bar graph of relative frequencies (%) -->

<!-- TODO actually calculate these from data -->

Expected sets: $$ E(S) = 4.9 $$

SD of sets: $$ SD(S) = 3.1 $$

# Payout

Payout formula: $$ P(S) = 2 * S $$

Expected payout: $$ E(P) = 9.8 $$

SD of payout: $$ SD(P) = 6.2 $$
