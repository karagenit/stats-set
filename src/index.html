    <p>
      In this game, you are trying to match together "sets" of three cards. Each card has three attributes: 
      shape (histogram, dot plot, box plot), color (orange, blue, purple), and number (one, two, or three). 
      For three cards to constitute a "set", the cards must have each of their attributes be the same or be different.
      <br><br>
      For example, the following three cards would be a set, because their shapes are all the same, their colors are all different, and their number are all different:
      <div class="center"><img src="./img/233.png"><img src="./img/212.png"><img src="./img/221.png"></div>
      On the other hand, this would <b>not</b> work, because two have the same color but the third has a different color:
      <div class="center"><img src="./img/321.png"><img src="./img/322.png"><img src="./img/313.png"></div>
      You can select cards by clicking on them - selected cards will highlight green. You are only given 60 seconds, so match quickly!
